# Initial goal
An attempt to port the
[source](https://github.com/technomancy/atreus/tree/master/case/openscad) of
the [Atreus](http://atreus.technomancy.us/) keyboard files from
[OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) to Clojure, that will then be converted
to OpenSCAD files, because Clojure is more sane language.

# Long term goal
The plan is to move the thumb cluster to be usable, and to allow as easy
transition between Kinesis Advantage or
[Dactyl](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard) to this, to be used on
top of a laptop keyboard. Also, would be neat to experiment with
[Alps](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Alps_SKCL/SKCM_series) or
[Matias](http://matias.ca/switches/quiet/) switches.
